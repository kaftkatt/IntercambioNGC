First setup.  

Information regarding the run: 

Fluid text based on the data file that one  can find under ../input/Z20x30. 
And the size.h_mpi one can find under ../code. 

The setup defines a rectangular basin, with 100 gridpoints in Y, 20 in X,
with horizontal resolution 5 km. It has 20 gridpoints in Z, size fixed at 30 m.

There is no stratification, temperature begin 15Â°C throughout. 
Equation of state is linear with the thermal expansion coefficient being 2e-4. 

It's run on the f-plane with f corresponding to 30 degrees north. 
We have a free surface, and slip at the bottom and sides with drag being 1e-3. 

It is run over 3 years with external forcing for 1 year. 

Heatflux is defined as a square of 80W/m^2 of size 100X100 km, 50 km from the
northern boundary. (see in InputVars.png)

Bathymetry is defined as 600 m depth everywhere except at the northern
(y=500 km), western (x=0) and eastern (x=100 km) walls. (InputVars.png)

Open boundary is orlanski in the south.
