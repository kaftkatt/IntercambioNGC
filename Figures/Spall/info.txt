Fourth setup.  

Information regarding the run: 

Fluid text based on the data file that one  can find under 
../input/Spall.  

The setup defines a rectangular basin, with 100 gridpoints in Y, 10 in X,
with horizontal resolution 5 km. 
It has 10 gridpoints in Z, size 60 m.

There is no stratification, temperature begin 15°C throughout. 
Equation of state is linear with the thermal expansion coefficient being 2e-4. 

It's run on the f-plane with f corresponding to the mean of 22.92 to 31.70 °N. 
We have a free surface, and slip at the bottom and sides with drag being 1e-3. 

It is run over 10 years with external forcing for 2 months every year. 

Heatflux is defined as a gaussian bump with of maximum 80 W/m^2 km at the
Center. It is set as negative to indicate a gain of temperature in the water (see in InputVars.png)

Bathymetry is defined as 600 m depth everywhere except at the northern
(y=500 km), western (x=0) and eastern (x=100 km) walls. (InputVars.png)

Open boundary is orlanski in the south.
