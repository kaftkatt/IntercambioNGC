Explanation of what varies between runs. 

Run:
Sponge, no balance applied 

Run2: 
Balance applied, no relaxation time scales defined for the Sponge Parm3 as following:
 &OBCS_PARM03
 Urelaxobcsinner=1728000.E0,
 Urelaxobcsbound=864000.E0,
 Vrelaxobcsinner=1728000.E0,
 Vrelaxobcsbound=864000.E0,
 spongeThickness=20,
  &

Run3: 
Balance and relaxation time scales defined in the sponge Parm3

Run4: 
Same as Run3 but I commented away the parts where orlanski conditions are defined 
Nothing changed really as orlanski is set to undef in OBCS_OPTIONS.h

Run5: 
Added prescribed files for temperature and velocity (only UVEL) as OBSuFile and OBStFile
Balance is off 
Relaxation time scales are defined

Run6: 
Added prescribed files for temperature and velocity (Both u and v) as OBSuFile,OBSvFile and OBStFile
Balance is off 
Relaxation time scales are defined 

Run7: 
No prescribed files 
Balance is on with OBCS_balanceFacS=-1.,
Relaxation time scales are defined

Run8: 
No prescribed files
Balance is on. 

&OBCS_PARM03
 Urelaxobcsinner=864000.E0,
 Urelaxobcsbound=43200.E0,
 Vrelaxobcsinner=864000.E0,
 Vrelaxobcsbound=43200.E0,
 spongeThickness=15,

Run9: 
Prescribed temperature 
Balance is on 
&OBCS_PARM03
 Urelaxobcsinner=864000.E0,
 Urelaxobcsbound=43200.E0,
 Vrelaxobcsinner=864000.E0,
 Vrelaxobcsbound=43200.E0,
 spongeThickness=15,

--------
This is how velocities are calculated in my runs with velocities 
#Values of velocity at open boundary
u0=0.025
uMerid=u0*np.ones((nx,nz,nt),dtype=dtype)

v0=0.025
vMerid=v0*np.ones((nx,nz,nt),dtype=dtype)+0.001
vMerid[:,:,np.arange(1,12,2)]=vMerid[:,:,np.arange(1,12,2)]-0.002
